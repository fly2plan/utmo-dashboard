## DONE

- Given a JSON schema that satisfies draft-04 a UTM flight plan submission form is programmatically generated.

## TODO

- Remedy UTM Flight Plan schema with that defined under the private data branch of `flight-chain-smart-contract`.
- Construct a javascript object, programmatically, which satisfies the schema.
- Validate this object before and after sending to the endpoint, and update each input of the form with the verdict of this validation (succeeded or failed).
- Add an authentication page (A UTMO has an identity)
- Add a page, in which the statuses of all flight plans the UTMO has submitted can be seen.
